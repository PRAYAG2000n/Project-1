Max-Min Grouping via Dynamic Programming
This project implements a dynamic programming algorithm to solve the Max-Min Grouping problem. Given an array A[1...N], the goal is to partition it into M contiguous groups such that the minimum group sum among all the groups is maximized. This is achieved through a carefully structured dynamic programming solution.

🧩 Problem Statement
Given:

An integer array A[1...N]

An integer M indicating the number of groups

Define a grouping G[1...M] such that:

Each group G[i] contains a contiguous subarray from A

The sum of each group is stored in array B[1...M]

Objective: Find the grouping that maximizes the minimum value in B

📊 Example
For input:

ini
Copy
Edit
A = {3, 9, 7, 8, 2, 6, 5, 10, 1, 7, 6, 4}
M = 3
The algorithm computes an optimal grouping where the minimum sum among the M groups is maximized.

🧠 Algorithm Summary
Uses a DP table dp[i][j] to store the optimal result for partitioning the first i elements into j groups.

Utilizes prefix sums to compute group sums efficiently.

A partitionTable is maintained to trace back the optimal group sizes.

Final outputs include:

Optimal group sizes (number of elements in each group)

Corresponding sums of each group

The maximum minimum sum

Time Complexity: O(M × N²)
Where N is the number of elements in array A

And M is the number of desired groups
